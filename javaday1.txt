Difference between Compiler and Interpreter:
   1) A compiler takes the entire program in one go.
       An Interpreter takes a single line of code at a time.
   2) The compiler generates an intermediate machine code.
       The interpreter never produces any intermediate machine code.
   3) The compiler is best suited for the production environment.
       An interpreter is best suited for a software development environment.
   4) The compiler is used by programming languages such as C,C++,C# etc.
       An Interpreter is used by programming languages such as Python, PHP, Perl etc.
